navigate to this folder in the terminal and run:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then go to a web browser (I'm using Chrome) and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you don't have python installed on your machine, install node:

https://nodejs.org/en/

then install http-server by typing the following into the terminal:

npm install -g http-server

then when it is installed, navigate to this folder and type:

http-server


when you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/, you will see links to each part of the engraving code
